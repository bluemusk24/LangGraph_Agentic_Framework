Here’s a quick snapshot of the top names right now:\\n\\n| Player | Club | Position | 2023‑24 Highlights |\\n|--------|------|----------|--------------------|\\n| **Lionel Messi** | Inter Miami (MLS) | Forward | 17 goals, 8 assists in 25 MLS games; record‑breaking 23‑point season in the Concacaf Champions League. |\\n| **Erling Haaland** | Manchester City (Premier League) | Forward | 34 league goals (a season‑long record) and 30 goals in 36 Champions League matches; key to City’s deep run. |\\n| **Kylian Mbappé** | PSG (Ligue 1) | Forward | 26 league goals, 8 assists; vital to France’s Euro 2024 semi‑final push. |\\n| **Karim Benzema** | Al‑Ittihad (Saudi Pro League) | Forward | 20 league goals; the highest‑scoring African player globally. |\\n\\n**Why Messi still gets most “all‑time” votes**  \\n- 7 Ballon d’Ors (world’s best individual award).  \\n- Record for most career goals in both club and international competitions.  \\n- Longevity and consistency across multiple leagues.\\n\\n**Why Haaland is the current “player of the year” conversation**  \\n- Raw goal‑scoring rate surpasses every other striker globally.  \\n- Integral to Manchester City’s league and Champions League success.  \\n\\n**Broader view**  \\n- **Mbappé**: Explosive pace, goal‑scoring, and all‑round play make him the most valuable “future‑proof” player.  \\n- **Benzema**: A master strategist and consistent threat, proving that top scorers can also be playmakers.\\n\\n**Bottom line**  \\nIf you’re judging by trophy haul and lifetime achievements, Messi tops the list. For pure current‑season impact, Haaland is unmatched. Mbappé bridges the two, promising a long, influential career.'"

      "== History ==\n",
      "LangChain was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.\n",
      "In the third quarter of 2023, the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) was introduced, which provides a declarative way to define chains of actions.\n",
      "In October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment tool to host LCEL code as a production-ready API.\n",
      "In February 2024 LangChain released LangSmith, a closed-source observability and evaluation platform for LLM applications, and announced a US $25 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital. On 14 May 2025 the company launched LangGraph Platform into general availability, providing managed infrastructure for deploying long-running, stateful AI agents.\n",

      "== Capabilities ==\n",
      "LangChain's developers highlight the framework's applicability to use-cases including chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation,  document summarization, and synthetic data generation.\n",
      "As of March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information, and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \"todo\" tasks in code; Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction, and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and summarization; MapReduce for question answering, combining documents, and question generation; N-gram overlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf for PDF file text extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation, analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database to store and retrieve vector embeddings; Weaviate vector database to cache embedding and data objects; Redis cache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API requests; SQL and NoSQL databases including JSON support; Streamlit, including for logging; text mapping for k-nearest neighbors search; time zone conversion and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols in threaded and asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha website and SDK.
