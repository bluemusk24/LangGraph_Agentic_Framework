    "[LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) make it possible to embed intelligence into a new class of applications. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a framework to help build applications with LLMs. Here, we will overview the basics of LangGraph, explain its benefits, show how to use it to build workflows / agents, and show how it works with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) / [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).\n",

    "[Chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) are the foundation of LLM applications. They are typically accessed through a chat interface that takes a list of [messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) as input and returns a [message](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) as output. LangChain provides [a standardized interface for chat models](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html), making it easy to [access many different providers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)."

    "## Workflows\n",
    " \n",
    "There are many patterns for building applications with LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "[We can embed LLM calls into pre-defined workflows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/), giving the system more agency to make decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we could add a router step to determine whether to write an email or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "![workflow_example](img/workflow_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further increase agency, allowing the LLM to dynamically direct its own tool usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#agent) are typically implemented as tool calling in a loop, where the output of each tool call is used to inform the next action.\n",
    "\n",
    "![agent_example](img/agent_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are well suited to open-ended problems where it's difficult to predict the *exact* steps needed in advance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Workflows are often appropriate when the control flow can easily be defined in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "![workflow_v_agent](img/workflow_v_agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph? \n",
    "\n",
    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/) provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath *any* workflow or agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control**: Make it easy to define and / or combine agents and workflows.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Provide a way to persist the state of a graph, which enables both memory and human-in-the-loop.\n",
    "- **Testing, Debugging, and Deployment**: Provide an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph lets you define your application as a graph with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *State*: What information do we need to track over the course of the application?\n",
    "2. *Nodes*: How do we want to update this information over the course of the application?\n",
    "3. *Edges*: How do we want to connect these nodes together?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [`StateGraph` class](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#graphs) to initialize a LangGraph graph with a [`State` object](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state).\n",
    "\n",
    "`State` defines the schema for information we want to track over the course of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be any object with `getattr()` in python, such as a dictionary, dataclass, or Pydantic object: \n",
    "\n",
    "- TypeDict is fastest but doesn’t support defaults\n",
    "- Dataclass is basically as fast, supports dot syntax `state.foo`, and has defaults. \n",
    "- Pydantic is slower (especially with custom validators) but gives type validation."

      "| 1 | **Use a concise, descriptive subject line** | The subject is the first thing the recipient sees; it determines whether the email gets opened. | • Keep it 5–7 words.<br>• Include key info (e.g., “Q3 Budget Review – Action Needed”). |\n",
      "| 2 | **Start with a polite greeting** | Sets a respectful tone and personalizes the message. | • “Hi [Name],” or “Dear [Name],” for formal contexts. |\n",
      "| 3 | **Get to the point quickly** | Busy people skim emails; a clear opening saves time. | • First sentence: state the purpose or request.<br>• Use bullet points for multiple items. |\n",
      "| 4 | **Keep paragraphs short** | Improves readability on screens and mobile devices. | • 2–3 sentences per paragraph.<br>• Use line breaks to separate ideas. |\n",
      "| 5 | **Use a clear call‑to‑action (CTA)** | Tells the reader exactly what you need from them. | • “Please review the attached file and reply by Friday.” |\n",
      "| 6 | **Maintain a professional tone** | Reflects on you and your organization. | • Avoid slang, emojis, or overly casual language unless appropriate. |\n",
      "| 7 | **Proofread for spelling, grammar, and tone** | Mistakes can undermine credibility. | • Read aloud, use spell‑check, or have a colleague review. |\n",
      "| 8 | **Use a consistent signature** | Provides contact info and reinforces brand. | • Name, title, company, phone, and a link to your calendar or website. |\n",
      "| 9 | **Consider the recipient’s time zone** | If you’re scheduling or asking for a reply, note the time zone. | • “Let’s meet at 10 AM EST (3 PM CET).” |\n",
      "|10 | **Use “Reply All” sparingly** | Avoid cluttering inboxes and potential privacy issues. | • Only include people who truly need the information. |\n",
      "|11 | **Attach files only when necessary** | Large attachments can clog inboxes and trigger spam filters. | • Compress files, use cloud links, and mention the attachment in the body. |\n",
      "|12 | **Follow up politely if needed** | Shows persistence without being pushy. | • “Just checking in—did you get a chance to look at my last email?” |\n",
      "|13 | **Respect privacy and data protection** | Especially important for sensitive or personal data. | • Use encryption or secure links for confidential info. |\n",
      "|14 | **Use formatting sparingly** | Bold or italics can highlight key points but overuse can look unprofessional. | • Highlight only the most critical information. |\n",
